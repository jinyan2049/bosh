Cloud Foundry BOSH is an open source tool chain for release engineering,
deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services.

## Configure Azure Environment

Recommend you to reference the guide [deploy_for_azure/guide_template.doc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/bosh/azure_cpi_crp/deploy_for_azure/guide_template.doc) to use [Azure Resource Template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/microbosh-setup) to configure your Azure account and dev machine.

Or you can do it step by step by following the guide [deploy_for_azure/guide.doc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/bosh/azure_cpi_crp/deploy_for_azure/guide.doc).

Currently MicroBOSH can only be deployed from a virtual machine in the same VNET on Azure.
After you configure your azure account, please create a VM in your VNET. 
Recommend you to use Ubuntu Server 14.04LTS. If you use other distros, please update install.sh before executing it.

## Install

To install the Azure BOSH CLI:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

git clone https://github.com/Azure/bosh.git

cd bosh/deploy_for_azure
./install.sh
```

You can download stemcell for Azure from http://cloudfoundry.blob.core.windows.net/stemcell/stemcell.tgz

To deploy MicroBosh, you can reference deploy_for_azure/config/micro_bosh.yml.

To deploy single VM cloud foundry, you can reference deploy_for_azure/config/micro_cf.yml.
